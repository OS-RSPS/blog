Within Neox, Wild Essence's primary function is to act as a charge modifier for the rate at which the <a href="https://blog.neox.ps/knowledge-base-wilderness-emblems/">Wilderness Emblems</a> gain charge. If you have Wild Essence in your inventory when you're in the wilderness and doing activities that generate charge, the charge rate will be increased as the dust is consumed; this increase is printed as a (bonus) value.

Currently, Wild Essence may only be acquired as a drop from the <a href="#">Donation Mystery Box</a>.
