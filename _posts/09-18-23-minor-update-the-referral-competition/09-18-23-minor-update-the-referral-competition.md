Hey there, everyone!

As we'd mentioned in last week's round of minor updates, we're going to be looking to start running various competitions and giveaways to promote the growth of our project before the official release on the 30th! As of the posting of this update, we're live for the Official Neox Referral Competition, and we invite anyone interested in participating and potentially winning some really cool prizes to join the Discord and compete!

For more information, and to be a part of the giveaways to come, please feel free to visit our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/neoxps">Official Discord</a>! Less than 2 weeks until our official release and we couldn't be more excited. Maybe we'll... see you there?

<em>Thanks!

<em>Neox Staff<br>
