<em>Hey there, everyone! As we'd hinted to (or rather, made like abundantly obvious), this particular patch was one that we'd wanted to divert a little bit of our tender love over into the direction of the most infamous swamp of the lands, Morytania. Adding a ton of different tasks, achievements, and perks for those achievements, we've introduced what we hope will act as a huge driving force for people to pull their rubber boots on and trudge themselves over and into the murk.

<em>Besides that, we've also gone through and patched a ton of bugs reported both from the Bounty Board (which has been a ton of fun, and thanks to everyone who's been contributing to it), and through other miscellaneous reports!</em>

<em>As a minor reminder, as of the posting of this patch notes update, we're still accepting and actively seeking to bolster the Beta Tester ranks. For those interested, please join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/neoxps">Community Discord</a> and apply through the appropriate channels. It is a requirement to be an approved beta tester before participating in the bounty system.</em>

<em>Thanks!</em>

<em>Neox Staff</em><br>

So, we know what you're thinking... or at least, we know what you might possibly be thinking and we for sure know what we're thinking: those Morytania achievement rewards sure seem strong; and the truth is? You're right, they are! One of the considerations we'd had when deciding what to give as rewards for completing the achievements stemmed primarily from community feedback. There's a very tough <em>equilibrium</em> to consider in that we want to make achievement rewards as enticing as possible to encourage members who might be interested beyond the motive of account completion to do them, but also don't want them to be so overtly imbalanced that not completing them is outright detrimental to the Neox experience. 

Regarding community feedback, we'd wanted to introduce achievements that had a little bit more direct impact in the experience of the game and gauge the reception and overall effect over the next short while. We're really quite exciting to see what happens in that regard, but for now? Hopefully the strength of these achievements should improve upon the experience of some otherwise fairly unenjoyable grind.

Alongside introducing the whole variety of perks unlocked through the different achievement tiers, we've also introduced a ton of different tasks to challenge players in completing different activities throughout the swamps. As with the pre-existing tasks, completion of these will reward coins that can be collected from the Taskmaster, along with points that will contribute towards achievement progress!

## Slayer Tower

Found within Morytania, the Slayer Tower is home to a large variety of monsters and will very, very likely be a place you find yourself in whilst being tasked with slayer monsters to track down and take out! Along with the large introduction of Morytania tasks, we've also implemented a ton of new titles and unlocks for this tower that will drastically improve the experience of those bold enough to enter!

<em>Below will outline all changes found within this patch. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to share feedback within our Official Discord! Once again, and as usual, we'd like to thank all of the beta testers for making this possible. Without the time you've invested into our project and the incredible feedback, we wouldn't be nearly as far along as we currently are, so thank you for everything you've done for us so far.
