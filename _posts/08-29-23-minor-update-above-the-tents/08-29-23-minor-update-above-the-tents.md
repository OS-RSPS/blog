Hey there, everyone!

A bit out of left field, but today's post is aimed as a slight nod and pat on the tush for the more daring of adventurers! As we continue to build upon the available lanes for training, where better to look than up? As of the posting of this update, the Shayzien agility course has been fully implemented within the server and is actively inviting Neoxians to come for a swing.

As with everyone update post we do, we'd like to thank everyone who's been involved within the project thus far and for your continued efforts in helping us to become something more than just another run-of-the-mill, one day at a time. As for the next update post? Well, let's just say a major point of contention within a specific repeating pop-up is firmly being addressed. Stay tuned for more!

<em>Thanks!
