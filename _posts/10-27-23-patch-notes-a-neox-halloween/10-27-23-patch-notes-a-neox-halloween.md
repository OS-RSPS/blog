<em>Happy Halloween, everyone!</em>

<em>Yes, yes, it's a bit early before the big day, but we'd wanted to ensure everyone had plenty of time to partake in the festivities that mark the beginning of the Neox Halloween Event! Throughout these patch notes, we'll touch base on exactly what's been changed, what to expect, and try to shine a little light on the other bits of content that are unfortunately being paired with our Halloween stuff and kicked onto the stage to try and share the spotlight.</em> 

<em>Within these patch notes, we'll explore the Halloween Event, the changes we've made with the tournament system, falconry, the much anticipated introduction of dynamite, and several other additions and adjustments made to the lands of Neox. As always, please scroll to the bottom of the page for a more thorough breakdown of all changes that have been made.</em>

<em>Boo!</em>

<h1 style="color:#f07d00;">Halloween Event</h1>

Once a serene and cozy hub, the Neox island has undergone a mysterious, thrilling, and spooky transformation! Gone are the gentle sunsets and soothing waves, replaced by eerie fog, pumpkins of all shapes and sizes, and peculiar creatures lurking about! It's as though the very island, in spirit of the season, has adorned a costume. With prizes to be earned, secrets to be found, and an ever looming threat to be banished, the official Halloween event has begun! From the date of this post, up until the 6th of October, members will be able to venture forth and partake in the peculiar, the dangerous, and the intriguing!


### <img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/hallicon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Spooky Island

What would a proper Halloween Event be without a proper makeover? Decorations a'plenty, the Neox island has been completely refaced in a way to better bring it in line with the Halloween spirit; members will find extensive changes to the overall look! With candy having been dropped about by careless enthusiasts, webbing seemingly spontaneously spun up, and changes to various NPCs (including one particular <em>good boy</em> who hangs out behind the shops), the island has been given one magical and monstruous makeover.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/102723/homeintro.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

We most definitely don't want to spoil all of the surprises though, so get out there and explore and be sure to let us know what your favorite discovery is. Ours? Well, there's only one goodest of boys... although he might not be so good anymore.

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/home1.png"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/home2.png"></center>

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/hallicon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Candy Collection

Like every good trick-or-treater, members who log in during this time will come prepared to hold plenty of candy! By participating through most activities throughout the world, candy will be generated and automatically stored within a newly generated pocket slot (to keep those inventories free of clutter), which can be viewed by clicking on the Equipment tab interface. Collect candy may be spent within the Spooky Cauldron at home for rewards!

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/candypocket.png"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/cauldron.png"></center>

Upon interacting with the cauldron, members will bring up a shop that will allow them to exchange their candy for assorted cosmetics, as well as a brand new Halloween Mystery Box which contains all kind of unique items!

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/hallicon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Halloween Event

The cause of all this mayhem and madness at home, you might ask? Well, it's none other than the terrible Lady Wraith! A figure draped in robes of the deepest ebony, who lurks the very graveyard the Neoxians have long buried their dead in, and a nose that could smell coffee being brewed in another hemisphere, this wickedly witch is the matriarch of our Halloween Event! 

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/ladywraith.png"></center>
<center><em><font size="1">Absolutely horrifying!... The nose, that is.</font></em></center>

When she manages to breach the barrier of the dead and goes back to the living, she beckons forth a legion of skeletons and thralls, bound by her otherworldly command! Every 2 hours, she'll resume command of the graveyard, and will require members to work together to banish her summons in order to weaken her and eventually bring her down. In order to banish them, members will simply need to use the "banish" option on them! Although utterly terrifying, they're not particularly strong, so members won't have to worry about receiving damage in turn, nor gaining combat experience during the interaction.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/102723/banishing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

Once enough of her summons have been defeated, she herself will also fall! Members will then be rewarded candy based on how much they'd contributed towards banishing her army, as well as a Halloween Mystery Box and a piece of the Witch outfit!

>To reiterate, members will not take damage nor will they gain any form of experience for participating in this event. This is to ensure members of all account preferences are able to participate (looking at you, skillers).

>A broadcast will play every 2 hours notifying members when the event is about to begin.

<h1 style="color:#57131b;">Tournament System</h1>

As mentioned within <a href="https://blog.neox.ps/minor-update-tournament-updates/">this</a> update, we'd been looking to make some improvement to the tournament system, both to encourage members who might not be as privy towards the violence within to dip in a toe and test the waters, as well as introduce a whole ton of new cosmetics and incentives as a whole for participating. Within this section, we'll outline the changes made and what members will be able to earn through participation!

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/102723/tournbanner.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/tourny.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Tournament Timers

As we're sure many of you are aware, tournaments before were being manually started. Not only was this not particularly intuitive, but it drastically limited the availability of the tournaments. Following this update, every 6 hours (at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC), tournaments will automatically started pulling their format from a pool of preset options. 

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/tournpresets.png"></center>
<center><em><font size="1">An outdated picture now, but it shows the gist of the possible formats.</font></em></center>

In time, we'll look to both add to the formats as well as remove the less popular/enjoyed ones. The weighting for the format selection is also entirely random, so there's no preferential treatment on which is selected!

>The countdown timer has also been improved upon, notifying members when the tournament is 15 minutes away, then 10 minutes, then 5 minutes, and finally at 2 minutes.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/tourny.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Tournament Rewards

Through participation, members can receive "Tournament Points", which is an account bound currency that may be spent within the Tournament Shop (trading the Tournament Guard) for unique cosmetics, weapon upgrades, and even just outright blood money conversion (1 point for 15,000 blood money). Placement, however, is everything! Members who place first will receive 10 points, second place will receive 5 points, third will be 3 points, fourth to tenth will receive 2, and anything below that will receive 1 point. Here's a clearer display:

>1st - 10 points<br>
>2nd - 5 points<br>
>3rd - 3 points<br>
>4th-10th - 2 points<br>
>10th and below - 1 point

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/tournshop.png"></center>
<center><em><font size="1">A champions shop for champions!... And also for everyone else.</font></em></center>

Alongside the introduction of the different items and titles scrolls, we've also added titles that may only be unlocked through winning tournaments! Members who wish to be acknowledged for their great accomplishments within the arena using these unique titles will be required to win 1, 10, 30, and finally 50 victories for the final unlock!

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

<h1 style="color:#457512;">Falconry</h1>

As a bit of a surprise, falconry is being added within this patch! For those unfamiliar, it's a unique form of training for the Hunter skill which provides a little more interaction than the traditional process of just setting up traps and idling around until something (or someone) happens to stumble into them. For more information regarding falconry, please <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Falconry">click here</a> to be forwarded to the official wiki (ours doesn't work a whole lot different from the official game).

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/102723/falconry.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

To access and begin training this skill, simply head on over to the teleport hub on the Neox Island, and under the Skilling tab select "Piscatoris Falconry Area". From there, head towards the man with the very spiky hair and follow through the dialogue in order to receive your very first falcon! Do be sure to bring 500 coins though for the exchange.

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/faltp.png"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/matthias.png"></center>

After talking with Matthias and paying him his fee, he'll give you a falcon with which you'll be able to begin training! We're not going to go too indepth regarding the skill training, mostly because these are patch notes and not really a guide, however for members who'd like to learn more, again, please <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Falconry">click here</a> to be forwarded to the official wiki! 

For those who'll take to collecting furs, do be sure to visit Asyff over at Varrock's Fancy Clothes Store to exchange your furs for some absolutely <em>furtastic</em> wears!

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/falwear.png"></center>
<center><em><font size="1">So stylish! Who dressed you? I must know!</font></em></center>

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

<h1 style="color:#c21a1a;">Dynamite</h1>

Skillers, rejoice, we have heard your plee! For those of you that seek completion in all venues (of a combat persuasion aside), dynamite has finally been introduced! Now, members will be able to interact with the Skilling Shop at home and begin building their very own cache of the volatile pots.

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/102723/dynshop.png"></center>

Remember though, this is only one part of the grand show. To be used for damaging NPCs, members must first combine them with Nightshade in order to add their poisonous effect! Besides that baseline interpretation from the original game, we've included a few custom adjustments to make them a little more effective:

>Dynamite(p) can be used on NPCs you would otherwise have the ability to attack, regardless of their current hitpoints.

>Has a regulated cooldown of 30 seconds in between uses.

>Isn't able to be lit on the ground, and may only be attached to NPCs.

Besides those few rules, the item will function the same as you would come to expect and will still require Nightshade to be made. 

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/102723/makedyn.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

After the dynamite(p) has been created, members may use it on attackable NPCs to inflict damage upon them with a chance to poison the target. In short, the idea is to allow members to kill specific target creatures whilst not actually gaining any combat experience in doing so. Did someone say... skiller slayer training time? Here's a hyper realistic depiction of the dynamite in action:

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/102723/ratdynamite.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

As always, we'll be keeping an eye on the behavior of this addition and seeing if there's anything we'll need to do improve upon it or rein it in a little bit. Until then though, bombs away!
