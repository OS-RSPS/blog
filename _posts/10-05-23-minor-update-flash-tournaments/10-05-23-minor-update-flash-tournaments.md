Hey there, everyone!

Today we'd run our first couple of flash tournaments of the server, and we have to say, it went pretty smoothly and it's going to be something we'll absolutely look to be running some more of in the future! For those who'd participated, we hope you had as much fun as we did, and we hope to see you there again for future flash events. It was pretty fascinating to see the different skill levels of the community within the different tournament formats. 

Also, a mighty big congratulations to community member Brad for having won every tournament that was run today! You're also subsequently banned from all future tournaments to increase tournament integrity and give everyone else a fair, fighting chance.

In the future, we're absolutely going to look to hold more official community events of this nature, making appropriate Discord announcements with countdowns and putting some really cool prizes up for grabs! We'll also look to improve upon a couple of the quality of life features within the tournament system itself, so stay tuned for that. 

Thanks, Neoxians, and we'll see you for the next minor update!
