Hey there, everyone!

As we draw closer to the release, we figured it's about time we start giving back to the community! For everyone who's been patient enough to remain a part of our Discord over this last little while, and for the new members to come, we'll be looking to host several upcoming giveaways and events both to mark the upcoming official launch of the project, as well as means to help pass the time with a little extra excitement.

The details for these giveaways will be coming quite soon, as we're just in the midst of working out all the fine details that'll make them all that much more interesting, so be sure to join the Discord to stay involved! As for the prizes? Well, let's just say there's to be no expense spared.

<em>Thanks!
