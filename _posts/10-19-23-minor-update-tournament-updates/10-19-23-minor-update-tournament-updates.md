Hey there, everyone!

For this update, we'll keep it short and sweet! When we'd originally introduced the tournament system, it served its very baseline purpose: provide a battleground for members to duke it out in a randomized, elimination style format until there was one contender left standing to crown the victor! With what's become a fairly high demand server activity, we wanted to take some time and build upon it in a way to make the activity significantly more engaging and worthwhile to participate in (especially for those who're a little less apt in the ring).

Within our next patch, the tournament system within Neox will receive the following additions and improvements:

<img src="/assets/img/updates/101923/sword.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Participation points will now be given to all members who participate. These points are account bound and will act as a currency to be spent within a new store that will feature unique cosmetics, Neox skilling items, loyalty vouchers, and allow for conversions to blood money.

<img src="/assets/img/updates/101923/sword.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Tournaments will now be automatically scheduled and randomized from a large pool for different formats. Notifications will be significantly more clear on when a tournament is happening and how long until it begins.

<img src="/assets/img/updates/101923/sword.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> The chat box has been integrated with a localized chat for spectating members to interact with one another when viewing bouts between the combatants!

>Among these additions, several of the more tedious interactions and bugs have also been fixed.

>Worry not, Hardcore players, deaths within the tournament are considered safe and will not cause you to lose your status. Feel free to join in on the chaos!
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

With this introduction, and the several more we have planned revolving around community events and engagement, we're hoping to foster a lot more member involvement and interaction with one another. 

Thanks, and see you on the battlefield!
