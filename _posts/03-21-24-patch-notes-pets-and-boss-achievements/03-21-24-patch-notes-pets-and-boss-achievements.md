<em>Hey there, everyone!</em>

<em>As mentioned within our <a href="https://blog.neox.ps/minor-update-the-big-plan/">Big Plan</a>, we'd wanted to touch on the pet rates in a way that organically addressed the otherwise quite stringent drop rates! Throughout these patch notes, we'll outline those very changes.</em>

<em>Worry not, these notes won't be nearly as long as our last ones... maybe!</em>

<em>Thanks,</em>

<h1 style="color:#ffa800;">Pets and Boss Achievements</h1>

In their original design the rates at which members were acquiring pets was... low. Alongside causing frustration both in particular boss pet hunts and completion of the collection logs tied to those specific bosses, it was a setup that overall just didn't feel healthy or fun for the game. With this patch, we'll be implementing an extensive threshold system that's been designed to lessen that barrier by improving the base pet drop rates and rewarding higher kill counts respectively. Additionally, we've touched on the rate at which members will acquire skilling pets and activity pets, more specifically in implementing pet rate thresholds for milestones such as achieving level 99, or the 200m experience marks, and for edge cases based on point systems, such as those within Wintertodt or Chambers of Xeric. And no worries, we didn't forget to account for boosters, but we'll touch base on that a little later.


### <img src="/assets/img/updates/032124/bosspet.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Boss Pets

When in pursuit of a bossing related pet, aside from outright having rebalanced all of the boss pet drop rates with the general goal of making them more common as a whole, the new threshold system will work by increasing that rate further with kill count milestones respective to each boss. For example, the base drop rate of Pet Dagannoth Prime is now 1/2500, with a threshold of 250, which means:
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<div class="inner-block">
- Between 0-249 kill count, the drop rate is 1/2500;<br>
- Between 250-499 kill count, the drop rate is 2/2500, or 1/1250;<br>
- Between 500-749 kill count, the drop rate is 3/2500, or approximately 1/833;<br>
- This continues with no cap on the scaling.
</div>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<center><em><font size="1">Perhaps getting some killcount would help with this rate!</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>

> Threshold counts are now displayed within the drop viewer. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for edge cases such as Wintertodt or Abyssal Sire, but we're slowly working on a Wiki for that very purpose! We'll also be outlining the new rates of said edge cases at the bottom of these notes.

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/032124/skillpet.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Skilling Pets

For Skilling Pets, we've added thresholds at different milestones that will improve on the chance of receiving the pet for each respective skilling activity:
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
<div class="inner-block">
- The first one, at level 99, will make the chance of pets twice as common from when leveling up;<br> 
- the second will further buff the rate after 200m experience making the pet chance four times higher when the skill has been completely maxed out.

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/032124/minigamepet.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Minigame/Edge Case Pets

Beyond adjustments to both bossing and skilling pets, we've also dialed in on pet rates across the variety of minigame and edge case pets Neox offers. In this instance, be "edge case", we're specifically referring to pets that won't have their information viewable through the drop viewer or are otherwise <em>not</em> skilling related pets. 

> It's worth nothing that all information within this section will be repeated at the bottom of this post within the more thorough patch notes breakdown.

<h5 style="color:#fa971b;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/032124/wtpet.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Wintertodt</h5>
1/2500 chance per reward roll with a threshold of 250, but based on the amount of lifetime reward rolls obtained from reward crates, rather than Wintertodt kill count. The number of rewards obtained is now displayed in the collection log below the Wintertodt kill count, but was not tracked before this update.

Additionally, pet boost tickets now affect the Abyssal orphan pet.

The Olmlet pet drop is still a 1/50 roll when obtaining any purple loot from the Chambers of Xeric, but now has a threshold 30, based on the amount of raids completed. Both regular and challenge mode completions count towards this threshold.

1/100 and 1/50 chance with a 10 and 5 threshold respectively, however the threshold only applies to the roll that happens when you complete a run. You may still sacrifice capes for additional chances at unlocking the pets, but these rolls will not be affected by or contribute to the thresholds.

            <h3>Features</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>

- Added a Pet threshold system.
    - This system improves the chance of obtaining pets as you repeat a specific activity.
    - For most boss pets, the chance to obtain a pet is increased by 100% every set amount of kills, which varies depending on the boss and its base rate.
    - Example: the base drop rate of Pet Dagannoth prime is now 1/2500, with a threshold of 250.
        - Between 0-249 kill count, the drop rate is 1/2500.
        - Between 250-499 kill count, the drop rate is 2/2500, or 1/1250.
        - Between 500-749 kill count, the drop rate is 3/2500, or approximately 1/833.
        - This continues with no cap. For example, between 2000-2249 kill count, the drop rate is 9/2500, or approximately 1/277.
    - The threshold count for a specific pet is displayed in the drop viewer.
    - For skilling pets, one threshold is added at level 99, and 2 more at 200m experience.
        - This means that after level 99, skilling pets are twice as common, and after 200m experience, they are four times as common.
    - Notable edge cases with information not available through the drop viewer:
        - Wintertodt: 1/2500 chance per reward roll with a threshold of 250, but based on the amount of lifetime reward rolls obtained from reward crates, rather than Wintertodt kill count. The number of rewards obtained is now displayed in the collection log below the Wintertodt kill count, but was not tracked before this update.
        - Abyssal sire: obtaining the Abyssal orphan pet is now a secondary 1/25 roll with a threshold of 5 when offering an unsired at the Font of Consumption. The number of unsireds offered is now displayed in the collection log below the Abyssal sire kill count, but was not tracked before this update. Additionally, pet boost tickets now affect the Abyssal orphan pet.
        - Chambers of Xeric: the Olmlet pet drop is still a 1/50 roll when obtaining any purple loot from the Chambers of Xeric, but now has a threshold 30, based on the amount of raids completed. Both regular and challenge mode completions count towards this threshold.
        - Fight caves & Inferno pets: 1/100 and 1/50 chance with a 10 and 5 threshold respectively, however the threshold only applies to the roll that happens when you complete a run. You may still sacrifice capes for additional chances at unlocking the pets, but these rolls will not be affected by or contribute to the thresholds.
        - Gauntlet: each tier of the Gauntlet has its own threshold that is affected by the completion count only of that specific tier. This means that completing the standard Gauntlet will not improve your chances of obtaining the Youngllef pet from the Corrupted Gauntlet and vice versa.
        - Wilderness bosses: each variant of the boss has a separate threshold. This means that Artio kills do not improve the chance of obtaining the pet drop from Callisto and vice versa, and the same applies to Calvar'ion/Vet'ion, Spindel/Venenatis and Chaos Fanatic/Chaos Elemental.
        - Herbiboar: 1/3000 chance with a threshold of 300.
    - Generic increases to pet drop rates (such as from the pet boost ticket) apply to the denominator in the roll, while thresholds apply to the numerator. This means their effects are multiplicative with each other.
        - For example, with 250 Dagannoth Prime kills the pet drop rate is 2/2500. An active pet boost ticket would then improve the pet drop rate to ~2/2083.
- In addition to the threshold system, boss pet drop rates have been rebalanced. As a general rule, they are now much more common.
- Boss jars have been removed from their respective boss collection log categories, and have instead been added to a separate Jars category. Their drop rates are unchanged.
- Added a new title as a reward for completing the new Jars category of the collection log: Oddity collector.
- The Pet dark core from Corporeal beast now uses a contribution based roll, rather than only the MVP getting a chance to unlock the pet.
- Added a new secret pet! Who's a good boy? 
- Added a Seers' Village teleport to the Neox Portal.
- Added teleports to the Prifddinas Farming patches to the Farming book.
- Piles, found in the Wilderness resource area, can now un-note items for a fee.
- The set of tasks related to total God Wars general kill count now has the God Wars category.

- Players are now limited to entering tournaments with only one account at a time.
- It is no longer necessary to bank all your items in order to enter a tournament. When entering a tournament, your currently held items will be safely stored away and then returned to you when you exit the tournament.
- Made some improvements to the Grotesque Guardians fight:
    - Removed the first lightning attack phase.
    - Lightnings now only start dealing damage 2 ticks after appearing, rather than instantly.
    - When Dawn returns to the fight, she will have the same amount of hitpoints as when she left, instead of always going back to 225.
    - Dawn's granite ball attack now has an AoE with a radius of 1 tile. Previously, it would only hit players if it landed directly on top of them.
- Increased the drop rate of the Dragonbone necklace and Skeletal visage drops from Vorkath.
- Significantly increased the drop rate of mutagens from Zulrah.
- Poison hits no longer interrupt player actions.
