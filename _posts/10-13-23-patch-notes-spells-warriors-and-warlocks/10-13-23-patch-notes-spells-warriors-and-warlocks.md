<em>Hey there, everyone!</em>

<em>Been a little while. Needless to say, launch was a fair bit busier than we'd anticipated, and we've been exceptionally busy each day tending to the incredible community feedback we've been receiving! Composed of the necessary quick fixes to keep the wheel spinning, brilliant suggestions to improve upon the overall game quality, and a ton of other ideas, our suggestion section (and unfortunately, equally the bug reports) has been absolutely brimming with responses... just like we'd been hoping for!</em> 

<em>It was a little tough for the first short while there to etch even the tiniest bit of time to progress through some of the post launch content we'd wanted to tend to, but finally, and with this update, we're able to bring forth the first post major content update post. Hopefully you're all as excited as we are. There's much, much more still to come; this is but the first step on a very long journey.</em>

<em>Thanks!</em>

<em>Neox Staff</em><br>

For those of you a little more privy towards a touch of the ol' violent tendencies, we've opened up an brand new avenue for such expression. Following this post and ensuing server update, the ever infamous PVP Armors will become available in the Blood Money shop... though not without a cost.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<em><center><font size="1">Which of these is your favorite, and why is it absolutely not the Morrigan's?</font></center></em>

For what might seem cheap at face value, these powerful items will need to be charged following their purchase for a substantial investment of blood money. Once charged, they will operate until the handler meets their demise, at which point they will drop 40% of the blood money investment value to whomever managers to overpower them, each losing their invested charge. These items will not disappear upon death and will remain with the original person to have purchased them; they will, however, lose their charge and will require another investment to be used again. Additionally, these items are restricted solely to activities within the Wilderness and will fail to function outside of its borders and may not be traded between members.

Will you be one of the few daring enough to acquire the different armors and harness their power? Though coming with a hefty cost (and equally hefty risk), they offer tremendous strength in the hands of those capable of wielding them. We'll be keeping a very attentive eye on the affect this armor has within the economy and will make any necessary adjustments over time!

>Remember, 40% of the charge cost is what's dropped upon death. These items will not disappear, but will need to be recharged before being used again. They will also need to be charge following purchase.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
>Consumable items, such as the Morrigan's Javelin or Throwing Axe will require a charge, much like the weapons, however will be able to be used an unlimited times until death. There is no ammo consideration for these items.

<h1 style="color:#885eac;">Warlocks</h1>
And for those who've an interest in the dark arts and all surrounding, we're finally introducing the Arceuus spellbook, and all twisted spells within! Warlocks who've proven themselves capable of handling this expansion of their magics through completing various Kourend tasks will unlock access and be given the Book of the Dead. 

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/101323/resurrect.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

For access to these dark magics, members will be required to complete the Kourend Citizen achievement; as access to the resurrection spells requires the Book of the Dead, those in pursuit will need to further their accomplishments and see the Kourend Noble achievement through! These spells include utility spells such as Shadow Veil, which will improve upon the success rates of auto-thieving, as well as the aforementioned resurrection spells, which will summon thralls to attack your enemies.

<em><font size="1">Very spooky!</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

Alongside this extensive spellbook, we've also introduced a ton of new content throughout the Kourend region! Members will now be able to explore through 144 new tasks based entirely in the Kourend and Kebos regions, progress through 9 new achievements, and reap the rewards that come with! We'll include more information on that through the patch summary at the bottom of the page.
