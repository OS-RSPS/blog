Hey there, everyone!

Following today's update, we can very excitedly share that the settings found within the modified interface are now fully functional and working as intended (though just a small reminder that all pre-existing settings have been reset to the defaults... sorry about that)! With the migrating of the doppelganger settings out of the old account management tab, we've since been able to repurpose that position for... well, actual account management tidbits.

Alongside the implementation of the new settings, we've also pushed a ton of fixes and content to the testing world which we'll be outlining next week during our proper beta patch notes. Hopefully you're able to enjoy your weekends! Until next time...

<em>Thanks!
