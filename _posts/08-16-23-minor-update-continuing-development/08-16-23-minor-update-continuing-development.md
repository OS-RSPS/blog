Hey there, everyone!

Following the release of our new Beta Bounties system, we were absolutely flooded with feedback! The Neox bounty hunters absolutely picked the content apart, finding a ton of different areas we could improve upon and so we fully intend to do just that. Throughout today, we've been tending to the continued feedback posts and bug reports, handed out a ton of shop credits as apparently elite void was the flavor of the day, and genuinely just had another super productive and wicked day with the community!

Coming tomorrow, we'll be looking to release the largest patch notes we've done yet which will outline all of the different bug fixes that've been pushed, the new content we've introduced since the last big patch breakdown, and just a general overview of everything else that may have been changed. Thanks again to everyone currently partaking in the beta and hunting down the bounties!

<em>Thanks!
