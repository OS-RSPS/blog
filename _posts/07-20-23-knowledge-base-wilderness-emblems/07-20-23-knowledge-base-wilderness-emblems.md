Wilderness Emblems are a utility item within Neox that utilizes point generation and a self-contained leveling system to encourage activity within the wilderness. Members are able to generate points for their inventory held emblem through varied actions such as wilderness skilling and killing bosses within the inventory. As points are generated to meet certain thresholds, the Emblem levels up and grants the user additional benefits (while subsequently increasing the return value, should the emblem be sold back to Ferox). 
<br><br>
The entire system acts as a <em>"high risk, high reward"</em> in the sense that players who're willing to risk their emblems and the materials they'll be gathering with them can reap the numerous benefits of possessing a higher tier emblem in their inventory while bossing or skilling, or selling it back to Ferox and receiving a sum of Blood Money that's directly affected by the total point value of the emblem. 
<br><br>
Within this knowledge base article, we'll elaborate on the different rates at which points are acquired, the benefits themselves to leveling up the emblem to its different tiers, and what to do with an emblem should you wish to sell it.

The emblem itself currently costs <span style="color:#885eac">150,000</span> coins and players are able to possess as many as they'd like. Regardless of how many a player might have in their possession, only one can be active at any given time while generating points. Emblems can be purchased from <span style="color:#885eac">Ferox</span>, who can either be located at his tent at the Neox home, or out in the wilderness within the Ferox Enclave. He is solely responsible for all emblem interactions at the moment, including purchasing from, selling to, and accessing the blood money shop.

Once an emblem has been purchased, the player must be sure they've stepped into the Wilderness before activating it or they'll be restricted in being able to do so. An unactivated emblem does not generate charge, so be sure to activate it before participating in any wilderness activities!

## Wilderness Emblem Activation

If you've chosen to take an emblem with you into the wilderness to compliment your activities, it's important that you first activate it! Remember, an unactivated wilderness emblem doesn't generate any charge. Activities such as mining, woodcutting, and PvM combat will generate a rate of charge that are balanced according to the level requirement of the activity involved and other external factors, such as the presence of <a href="#">Wild Essence</a> within a player's inventory.

<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/knowledgebase/wildernessemblem/activatingemblem.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>

Wilderness activites that generate points contribute to the overall level of the emblem. The emblem itself is designed in a way that when a certain amount of points are acquired, it will level up into a higher tier and provide an increased set of benefits scaling with said tier. 

<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

## Wilderness Emblem Perks

The emblem itself currently has 5 different tiers, each of which provide ever increasing benefits to the varying wilderness activities. The only way to have these benefits be applied to the activities is to possess the emblem within the player's inventory, hence the <em>"high risk, high reward"</em> factor. The benefits are by no means a laughing matter, however, are they're quite strong! Within this section, we'll outline the different benefits for each of the tiers and the point requirement for each.
<br><br>
To check the progression of your emblem as you gain skill, simply click on the emblem itself and it will print the current amount of points you possess within the chat. The benefits of your current tier can also be viewed by right-clicking on the emblem and selecting "Benefits".

## Wilderness Emblem Leveling

The emblem itself can be slowly leveled throughout a variety of different activities. Within this section, we'll briefly review a couple of examples and outline relevant information to each. 

>It is worth nothing that with the introduction of <a href="#">Wild Essence</a>, the rates at which wilderness emblem points can be acquired has been drastically increased.

<h1 style="font-size: 20px; color:#885eac">Skilling</h1>

Once an emblem has been activated, it's ready to begin leveling. For this <a href="https://blog.neox.ps/knowledge-base/">Knowledge Base</a> entry, we'll be using the mining skill as our baseline example of how to level the emblem within this section. With that in mind, the first thing we'll want to do is head over to one of the most accessible skilling areas within the wilderness, the Wilderness Resource Area.
<br><center><img src="/assets/img/knowledgebase/wildernessemblem/resourcearea.png"></center><br>
Skilling within this area can be particularly dangerous, simply because you're isolated and a very far distance from being able to save yourself should another player begin attacking you. For that reason, it's not advised the player uses this particular area as their primary means of leveling their emblem unless they're making use of <a href="#">Resource Transporters</a> and don't mind the risk of losing their wilderness emblem in the process. The perks themselves of a high level wilderness emblem can make the risk worth it.

<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/knowledgebase/wildernessemblem/miningpoints.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>

As seen in the video above, mining generates points that contribute to the overall level of the emblem. The emblem itself is designed in a way that when a certain amount of points are acquired, it will level up into a higher tier and provide an increased set of benefits. Skilling is currently the fastest way of leveling up an emblem, however is also the riskiest with respect to efficiency in lacking combat supplies to defend yourself over inventory space and weight.

<h1 style="font-size: 20px; color:#885eac">Combat</h1>

Combat when leveling a player's Wilderness Emblem can involve bossing, doing slayer tasks, or just randomly fighting the wilderness monsters. Bossing of the three is considered the least efficient means of leveling up the emblem due to the kill time involved with each boss fight; however, bringing a high level emblem into a boss instance can tremendously speed up and ease the difficulty of the fight.
<br><br>
Leveling an emblem through combat is the <em>safest</em> means of leveling an emblem as typically players will be wearing combat equipment and bring supplies that can greatly influence their chances of successfully defending themselves. 

<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/knowledgebase/wildernessemblem/combatemblem.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>

>This particular video demonstration of leveling your emblem through combat is why it's strongly ill advised that players seek out fights with members of the Administrative team.

            <h3>Selling a Wilderness Emblem</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

## Selling a Wilderness Emblem

A player is able to sell their wilderness emblem at any time to Ferox, however it is advised they wait until the higher tiers of emblem leveling before doing so as the value of the emblem scales exponentially with each tier increase. Players who choose to sell their tiers will be offered an amount of blood money that is calculated by the tier of the album, following by the overall point value. As emblems themselves don't have a point cap, though are restricted to a maximum tier, the most efficient means of converting wilderness emblems to blood money is to first get them to tier 5 through wilderness activities and then selling them; remember, the more points you have overall on the emblem, the more the multiplicative value the tiers will provide.

<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/knowledgebase/wildernessemblem/sellingemblem.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>

>Emblems have not been leveled to a higher tier are worth significantly less than their gp:bm conversion value. As a result, selling an emblem less than tier 5 is not recommended.

Emblems sold to Ferox will be changed for Blood Money. In Neox, this currency is used for purchasing special items only available within Ferox's shop. These items range from everything including combat equipment, wilderness exclusive consumables, and even items otherwise only ascertainable through boss drops.

>With the selling of rare boss drops, some skillers will opt to farm blood money through wilderness skilling with the emblem to gain access to the dragon axe and dragon pickaxe.
