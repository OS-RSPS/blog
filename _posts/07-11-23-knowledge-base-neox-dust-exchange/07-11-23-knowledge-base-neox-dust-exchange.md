Directly tied to <a href="https://blog.neox.ps/updates/">Neox Dust</a>, the Dust Exchange is the central hub for purchasing Dust related items. Its contents include a variety of items including <a href="https://blog.neox.ps/knowledge-base-neox-supply-crates/">Supply Crates</a>, <a href="https://blog.neox.ps/updates/">Bonus Experience Lamps</a>, and a variety of cosmetic items that are constantly changing stock. To access this shop interface, a player must already be in possession of Neox Dust and from there they simply have to interact with the item and click "Redeem"; doing so will immediately open the Dust Exchange interface.
