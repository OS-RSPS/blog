<em>Hey there, everyone! For today's patch notes, we've got quite a bit to share. It's been an incredibly busy and productive last little while within Neox, so we'll do our very best to outline all of the recent changes, fixes, and introductions of exciting new elements within the game. Climb aboard, buckle up, and let's get started!

<em>Thanks!</em>

<em>Neox Staff</em><br>

<h1 style="color:#885eac;">Settings</h1>

For the more diligent of update readers, you're no doubt already well aware it was within our scope to reform the settings within Neox in a way that makes them significantly more manageable (such as removing the redundant overlapping of the two pre-existing menus), and to overall just tighten up both the response and effectiveness of them as a whole. Within this patch, we've finally pushed through said modifications and have placed all settings within a new home and introduced a customized tab that will allow for players to make adjustments to the unique systems within Neox.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/090523/settings.webm" type="video/webm"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

Members will now be able to toggle options such as specific broadcast messages, Neox task interactions and notifications, and even varied confirmation checks for the player who needs only be asked once! In place of the old settings menu button, we've since divided the old, overloaded  navigation menu and placed all information relevant to a member's account within. 

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<em><center><font size="1">Hopefully this should make things a little easier to navigate.</font></center></em>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

<h1 style="color:#885eac;">The Website</h1>
One of the major features within these particular patch notes is the release and open access of our website. We've spent many a long night working to finally getting this in place (which means no more automatic blog redirections!), so we're very much quite excited to finally share our website with everyone. For those interested in checking it out themselves, please <a href="https://neox.ps/">click here</a>.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/090523/websitelanding.png"><br>
<em><font size="1">A small preview of the homepage.</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

The website itself is intended to act as a central hub for the majority of outside game elements, including the hiscores, voting page, and an account management page that will allow for members to implement 2FA (which is a task within the game!), validate their emails, connect their Discord accounts with their profiles, and of course the standard account support features. As the website is currently open to the public, this also means that the registration is also available (though accounts generated won't have access to the beta by default), so make sure to snag your name in advance!

We'll be continuing to smooth out any kinks found within the website during its use. If you happen to stumble across any issues during your exploration or utilization, please consider taking the time to report them within our Discord and we'll get it sorted as soon as possible! 
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

## Website Hiscores

One of the features within the website we're incredible proud of and excited to see the community involvement within is the hiscores! Currently, the hiscores include a variety of different filters than can be applied to modify the search results (such as account game mode selected, the XP mode that's been set, and the numerous builds), a ton of different default categories that track player progression across a wide variety of activities within the server, and will allow for players to click each member's name for a more indepth look into their profile.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/090523/hiscoresmain.png"><br>
<em><font size="1">The landing of the default hiscores page. We see you, Robo!</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

Listings will also include different icons to signify account information at face value, such as the experience difficulty they're playing on by the color of the sword beside their name, the account type by the type of corresponding helmet, and their position within the leaderboard. Of course, as mentioned, these listings can be sorted by utilizing the upper navigation within the page to live update the display.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video width="80%" height="80%" autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/090523/hiscoresnavigation.webm" type="video/webm"></video></center>
<center><em><font size="1">There's even timers for the selected durations!</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

Clicking on a member's entry will take you to their page where you're able to view a bunch of different information regarding their account, such as an overall stat listing, an adventure log, and a more indepth display of their accomplishments and progression throughout Neox! As we continue to develop and release content within the project, the profile information will be updated accordingly, so stay tuned for more.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

## Website Voting

What would a website be without a voting page? Members who wish to earn loyalty points within the server and compete within the monthly voting competitions we'll be hosting are invited to visit our very own voting page. The only requirement is that the member is logged into their account at the time of voting... otherwise how else would we track who's been voting? It's worth noting, however, that voting with multiple accounts using the same IP address will not register the votes beyond the first ones submitted, so do make sure you're on the right account before initiating any votes!

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/090523/votinglanding.png"><br>
<em><font size="1">The landing page of the voting. We really need to up our own voting game.</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

Voting itself couldn't be any simpler! Simply click on one of the buttons below the listed site and follow through the process of submitted a vote. There's no need to submit your username or modify any special fields or anything fancy like that, as we've tied it all up together in the back end to make the process as seamless as possible. Once your vote has been submitted and the callback received, the button will automatically update with a timer on when you'll be able to vote again. Following that, simply speak with the Loyalty Manager at home and you'll be able to claim your submitted votes.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
>It's worth noting that the voting process itself is fully functional, however the listings are currently acting as placeholders and don't actually contain any worthwhile media or project representation.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

## Website Account Management

Alongside its many other features, the website is also responsible for housing the personal account management. Within this panel, members will be able to verify their emails and set up their 2fa (both of which we absolutely advise for account security purposes), as well as link their discord accounts, or change their passwords or emails. Clicking on any of the boxes will load a pop-up menu that will allow the members to proceed accordingly.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<em><font size="1">Don't forget to link your discord account, verify your email, and set-up 2fa! Big secure.</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

The website itself, though finally in a state where we're able to share it with the community and begin allowing open access, is still very much a soft work in progress that we'll continue to hone in on as the days go by. As mentioned, if you happen to discover any odd interactions, stubborn features that refuse to work, or have general feedback regarding something we can improve upon, please feel free to share it within our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/neoxps">Community Discord</a>.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

<h1 style="color:#885eac;">Plugins</h1>

One of the most exciting endeavours available to us by using a Runelite client for the base (the monstrous headaches it's regularly been causing aside), is the ability to create our own plugins that can fluidly interact with the content of our humble project. Our latest plugin, though no doubt many of you are already aware, is designed to fully compliment the task system within Neox in allowing members to track their progress <em>outside of the game</em>.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video width="80%" height="80%" autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/090523/taskupdate.webm" type="video/webm"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

This plugin is designed in a way that will allow for members to view the task rewards, filters through tasks based on a large variety of filters, and will live update with their progression ingame (synced to whichever account may be logged in). For a bit more of an indepth look into the plugin, our <a href="https://blog.neox.ps/minor-update-task-tracker/">older update post</a> does a pretty good job outlining it.

<h1 style="color:#885eac;">More</h1>

## Bonfires

Among many other changes we've made within the game, including minor alterations to gameplay systems with the intention to improve their quality of life, we've also taken to introducing content solely based on beta testing feedback and foresight. One of the newest additions in this regard is that of a bonfire access at the home! Players who're interested in a slightly less attention intensive means of leveling firemaking will now be able to make use of the bonfire at the campsite to automatically feed logs into it for experience at a reduced tick rate from the normal speed. 

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video width="80%" height="80%" autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/090523/bonfire.webm" type="video/webm"></video></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
>It is worth nothing that the bonfire also accepts use of Neox logs and converts them to dust and experience as you'd expect.
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
>This same automatic feeding system will also work with player created fires.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

## Activities

Above all, one of the most critical principles within Neox is the unimpaired access to every door, ladder, lever, portal, stepping stone, staircase, trap door, agility stile, and otherwise interactable object access point. It goes without saying that the very fragile essence that embodies immersion is instantaneously shattered should such an otherwise presumably navigable object be met in turn with the ever harrowing "nothing interesting happens". Over the last short while, such discoveries (to the unparalleled dismay of the adventurer responsible) have been surfacing and have become the highest priority amidst our team for resolution. It is with great relief we can share that the a wide variety of activities, such as opening doors, climbing ladders, or pulling levers, have been corrected in a timely fashion to their intended function.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
Rest assured, dearest Neoxians, knowing we will not stop our conquest until every one of these blatant transgressors has been rooted out and dealt with... without mercy.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<h1 style="color:#885eac;">Patch Summary</h1>

<em>Below will outline all changes found within this patch. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to share feedback within our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/neoxps">Community Discord</a>. As each day passes, we draw ever closer to the closing of the beta application process and will eventually look to close the beta down as well. Over the last couple of months, the beta testing feedback and general reception has been absolutely incredible, and without the help of everyone involved this wouldn't have been possible. With that in mind, we'd wanted to continue to thank everyone who's taken the time to be a part of this project.</em>
