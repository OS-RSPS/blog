Hey there, everyone!

Firstly, hopefully everyone's been enjoying their week and has lined themselves up something even <em>slightly</em> noteworthy for the weekend! And hey, if not? Well, you could always come play the Neox beta and at the very least be among friends! For this week's final post, we've a couple of things to report, though nothing of the outmost exciting nature. Come next week though? It's going to get a little crazy, so definitely stay tuned! Firstly, Nex has been further progressed to the point where we've begun introducing achievements surrounding the upcoming boss alongside implementing the correct means of accessing the boss!

Also, to save the very arduous process of having to buy massive stacks of anything, we've now modified the shop interface to allow for a "buy-x" option! Squirrel, you may now rejoice (and to everyone else who perhaps found out that removing stacks of tridents will reset its charges, or getting one as a monthly task completion award resets its charges, or really just looking at it a little funny will reset its charges), for this will become available with our next update!
