##### Server Rules and Guidelines

Below will outline the official Neox rules. As a disclaimer, these are simply a rough outline and we trust our staff to enforce them to the best of their discretion. Players found attempting to circumvent the rules in any sense, regardless of how clever a loophole they believe to have found, will be punished all the same! We entrust our members to do their best at interpreting and adhering to these rules if they wish to be a part of the Neox community.

## <span style="color:#845cad">General Behavior</span>
<em>Inappropriate Language, Conduct, and Ethics</em>

At Neox, we believe in exercising common sense; racism, slurs, derogatory remarks, and really just any sort of statements or behavior intended to offend or demean any of our community or staff members will be met with zero tolerance. We want our community to be a place of feeling welcomed, a place where members feel safe to be themselves and can enjoy the social interactions of the game. Our staff will be gauging any behavior that conflicts with this goal with their own discretion and will punish accordingly. 

Being a member of this community is an open invitation to anyone and everyone. We continue to work hard on our project and want members to be able to appreciate everything it has to offer. Behaving in a way that’s detrimental to the community experience as a whole is, simply put, is something we won’t tolerate; common sense ruling applied.

## <span style="color:#845cad">Real World Trading</span>
<em>Selling Ingame Items, Accounts, or Account Names using third party websites</em>

Any attempts at selling ingame items, gold, accounts, or account names utilizing third party websites or back channels will not be tolerated. Neox offers a shop, accessible via ingame menus and the website itself, where members are able to purchase credits and cosmetic items that can be then exchanged in game with other players, should they wish (or alternatively worn themselves for big fashionscape points). This is the only form of website:game interaction that is permitted regarding the transaction of items or gold.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

## <span style="color:#845cad">Staff Impersonation</span>
<em>Impersonating a member of Neox staff in any way, shape, or form</em>

Impersonating a member of Neox staff is greatly frowned upon. With that in mind, a member of our team will never ask you for any of your personal information directly, nor will we ever attempt to access your account or ask you to visit a specific site outside of the Neox directory. Members of staff will always have a crown next to their name. If a member messages you claiming to be a member of staff, please report the behavior immediately so it can be addressed.

<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

## <span style="color:#845cad">Item Scamming</span>
<em>Attempting to gain items/money through the scamming of other Neox members</em>

Scamming items, by our definition, is defined as attempting to acquire items or gold from another player at their own fault by tricking or deceiving them in any fashion; there are known, numerous methods in which players have been taking advantage of other players for quite some time, so we won’t be outlining them here, however the act of deliberately preying on another member’s naivety for one’s own gain by definition of item scamming falls into the category of General Behavior as a whole and as such will not be tolerated.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

## <span style="color:#845cad">Bug Abuse</span>
<em>Abusing bugs or glitches to gain an advantage over other players</em>

Any attempt at abusing bugs, regardless of the end result, will not be tolerated. As a project that will constantly be under development, pushing new and unique content, there’s bound to be the outlying oddity that may appear! We ask that members who’re clever (or potentially just enigmatic in their luck) enough to discover them to please report them utilizing the appropriate channels, or to inform a member of staff so that they may reach out to our developers and have said bug dealt with appropriately. We’re quite enthusiastic about squishing the little critters in our code!

<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

## <span style="color:#845cad">Gambling</span>
<em>Flower Poker, Dicing, etc.</em>

Gambling, under any title or loophole, is permitted within Neox. The only point we wish to emphasize regarding participating in said activity is that although it’s sanctioned, it’s to be engaged in at one’s own discretion; by this, we mean that staff intervention will be done only at a very last resort and at their own prerogative, and is not something we will be emphasizing our staff to address. Gambling will be entirely moderated by the community as it sees fit, without staff oversight, so keep this in mind before testing your standing with lady luck against another player.

## <span style="color:#845cad">Macroing and Third Party Software</span>
<em>Botting, Macros, and Cheating</em>

Botting, as it’s more commonly known as, is strictly prohibited. This can include macros for automating specific server interactions, utilizing automated switching software for leveraging an advantage over another player, or really just any software outside of our game client honed in providing an edge over another player. From a player’s perspective, downloading and attempting to run an outside client is a massive risk to both your own account’s security from a phishing perspective, but will also be flagged from our internal systems and have your account restricted from our perspective.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

## <span style="color:#845cad">Advertising Websites</span>
<em>Gold Selling, Account Services, etc.</em>

Advertising websites, regardless of their purpose, is strictly forbidden. The only addresses permitted for members to share are branches of the Neox domain. From the player experience, visiting a website someone has advised you to go to can result in a variety of nefarious activities, such as having your IP logged (in an attempt to DDOS your internet connection) or your account details being phished. We ask that members use their own discretion and report anyone making an effort to guide members into visiting outside websites.

##### Discord Automated Punishment System

Below will outline the behavior guidelines for the official Neox Discord server. Though the rules themselves aren't particularly strict, we trust the judgment and discretion of our staff team to enforce common sense above all. The server itself will be manually moderated by a handful of select staff, alongside there being automated moderative processes in place. Members who fail to follow the rules or behave in a way not permitted by the automation process will receive <em>strikes</em> on their account. These strikes have accumulative point values which will initiate automated punishments on their accounts. Below will outline the automated strike system and what behavior will trigger an automated response.

<img src="/assets/img/knowledgebase/guidelines/automodsettings.png"><br><br>
> <div class="command-title">Bad Words</div>
>> Composed entirely of slurs or other racial remarks. We don't mind profanity usage from our members, within reason.
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
><div class="command-title">Repeated Text</div>
>>Spamming the same message over and over again. Currently, the threshold is set to be the same string of text found within a message several times, or alternatively spamming the same low character message again and again.
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
><div class="command-title">Zalgo Text</div>
>>Text designed to distort or drastically affect the display of a message in a negative manner.

Currently, the settings are particularly lenient, however this may be adjusted at a later time if deemed necessary:

<img src="/assets/img/knowledgebase/guidelines/punishmentsettings.png"><br>

The strike system itself is entirely automated, which means we've configured the Neox Support Bot to moderate these actions automatically. Members who're given a strike will receive a DM outlining what's happened and their message will be deleted. As outlined above, strikes work as a compound system in that accruing too many of them within the 30 day period will result in an escalating punishment system. The system itself is lenient enough that only drastic actions are automatically punished and thus actions that receive strikes through this system are non-appealable. <br><br>

##### Discord Guidelines

Below we'll outline the expected behavior of members within our Discord. For the most part, a lot of this will be dictated by common sense, however we feel it's important that members familiarize themselves with these guidelines before taking an active role within the Neox Discord! Failure to adhere to these guidelines will result in account punishment and potential removal from the community Discord.
