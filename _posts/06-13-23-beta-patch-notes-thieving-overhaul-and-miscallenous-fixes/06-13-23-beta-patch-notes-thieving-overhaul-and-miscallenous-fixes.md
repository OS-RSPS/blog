<em>Hey there, everyone! As I'm sure everyone can agree, there's certain skills among the game that just aren't that enjoyable to train, or are egregiously unapologetic in how input intensive they are for the payout. With this in mind, it's always going to be a goal of our to take the very baseline content of the game and modify it in ways that make for an enjoyable experience. We'll always be looking to kind of adapt the game in that regard without altering it too drastically as to veer off from the original identity. As with our mining changes from before, we're now tackling thieving to remove some of the lesser enjoyable mass clicking and grinding aspects from the skill and have resultingly introduced some pretty drastic changes that we think will be for the better. Alongside the thieving overhaul, we also have a ton of smaller fixes and adjustments to share with you all. As always, we welcome any and all feedback through the appropriate channels.

<em>Thanks!

<em>Neox Staff<br>

- Added 30 new thieving tasks to go along with the thieving overhaul.
- Pickpocketing actions are now repeated with no input necessary, if successful. Repeat pickpockets happen every 3 ticks, while manual pickpocketing can be performed once every 2 ticks.
- Pickpocketing will be interrupted if players get caught by the NPC, or if they pickpocket over a certain number of times in a row.
- Most thieving actions now reward the player with one of 4 different tiers of a new item called 'Bag of Riches'.
- These bags are stackable and can be looted for coins and gems. The highest tier of bag can even contain Onyxes. They also have a right-click option to loot up to 300 of them at a time, to reduce the amount of clicking required.
- Added a new achievement: 'Renowned Thief'. Rewards the gloves of silence, which improve pickpocket success rate, and a new 'Thief' title.
- Added map labels describing areas of the new Home Island.
- Added Agility Pyramind & Pyramid Plunder to the minigame teleports.
- Added a cows teleport to the teleport portal.
