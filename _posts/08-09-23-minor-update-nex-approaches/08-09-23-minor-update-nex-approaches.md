Hey there, everyone!

As we continue to progress through our closed beta, we continue to receive feedback and bug reports that've been keeping us exceptionally busy! Some of the discoveries have ranged from the most absurd interactions, to the accuracy in timing requirements that only the most well versed of testers would notice! Needless to say, we couldn't be happier with how active the beta has been.

Amidst fixing all of the bugs and fine tuning the server with the constant flow of feedback, we've also been putting on the final garnishes to an otherwise quite unpalatable, dungeon imprisoned piece of poultry: <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Nex">Nex</a>, an exceptional challenge for the bold and brave, will very soon be pecking at our beloved Neoxians... though more to come on her behalf soon!

That's all for now! We'll continue to work ever diligently in thinning out and tending the ever growing harvest of bug reports as our closed beta continues to chug along. If you wish to be a part of our humble project, please don't hesitate to click the button below!

<em>Thanks!
