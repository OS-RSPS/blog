<br>
Within Neox, players will have access to a variety of commands, each serving a different purpose or acting as means to improve the overall accessibility and quality of the game. Within this Knowledge Base article, said commands with be outlined on what they do and the allowed variations that can be input for the same result. Should any questions or concerns arise regarding our server commands, please don't hesitate to contact a member of staff!

As a reminder, command utilization must be prefaced with either a "::" or a ";;" before the server will register their input;or example, if a player wished to check the available staff online, they must type "::staff" or ";;staff" and the interface will appear that shows the available staff members. Also, command listings that have brackets are simply user input fields and will not require the brackets; for example, a listing here might say "::ccban (user)", but the usage ingame would be "::ccban username".

The majority of command usage is currently logged and members found attempting to exploit the commands or generally misusing them will be dealt with accordingly. We'll do our very best to keep this article updated as well!

Thanks,

Neox Staff
