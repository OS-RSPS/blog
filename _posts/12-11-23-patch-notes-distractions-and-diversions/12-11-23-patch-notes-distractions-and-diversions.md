<em>Hey there, everyone!</em>

<em>As of today's patch, the new event system will be introduced within Neox! We've talked about this plenty, outlining how its primary purpose is to act as the foundation for which we'll be able to easily build upon, so we won't spend too much time reiterating upon the same notes. It's been a little while since we've done a nice big update like this with some proper notes, so just a reminder... for those of you looking to speedrun through and get straight into the nitty gritty without the fluff, the formatted patch notes at the very bottom of this article outline all of the changes made within this patch!

We'd wanted to include the Instanced Infernal side content within this patch as well, however some last minute design changes and a couple of modifications to the behavior and performance caused us to postpone it until the next update we do (which won't be too long from now)! Sorry about that. We'll continue updating the Discord roadmap as well to reflect these sort of developments.

<em>For those of you who enjoy reading through? Well, let's get started!</em> 

<em>Thanks,</em>

<em>Neox Staff</em><br>

<h1 style="color:#885eac;">The Events System: "Distractions and Diversions"</h1>

So firstly, it's important that we establish that although we've been referring as this new system to the "Event System", (just because we... started doing that originally and haven't made the switch... sorry!) they'll actually be referred to as "Distractions and Diversions", something infinitely more fancy sounding! This system is designed to cycle through events unique to our project that will happen every 2 hours. With these new events, members will be able to join in and earn all kinds of rewards, including those that're entirely unique to the specific event's drop tables and will provide bonuses throughout their adventures across the Neox world.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

The events themselves will be managed by a newly introduced NPC at home who goes by the name of "D&D Announcer", someone you might just see hollering every little while to announce the coming of new events and timers as they draw closer. Interacting with this NPC will allow members to view the planned schedule, teleport directly to the selected event grounds, or to go through additional dialogue and learn more about the system. He can be quite the chatty fellow, so do indulge him at your own discretion.

Additionally, this update will bring in a variety of new tasks involving D&D activities as a whole and for their respective events for members to complete and new titles to pursue! As always, we'll look to continue expanding upon the task variety and titles that come with as we introduce new content.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>

Within the next section, we'll outline each of the events being introduced within this patch. With the entirety of the groundwork for expansion on this system being introduced alongside these base events, we'll be looking to continue introducing new events every little while for members to go through and experience!

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/star.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Shooting Stars

In this event, a shooting star will crash somewhere around the world. Members will be able to gather around and mine this star, granting both mining experience and stardust. Don't forget your pickaxe!

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/miningstarpng.png"></center>

This stardust acts as a tradable currency members will be able to bring over to Dusuri's Star Shop, located by the entrance of the Mining Guild in Falador, in exchange for the Celestial Ring (an item which gives a hidden +5 mining boost when charged with Stardust, and grants a 12% chance to mine double core ores), for Star Fragments (which can be used to cosmetically alter pieces of the Prospector outfit), or for other miscellaneous goodies.

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/kbd.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Empowered King Black Dragon

Within this event, an empowered version of the King Black Dragon will appear West of the Demonic Ruins in the Wilderness. Be warned, however, that this is deep in the wilderness and is a multi-combat zone!

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/kbdbanner.png"></center>

Any player who deals enough damage to the KBD will receive an amount of coins, wild essence, black dragonhide, and dragon bones based on the amount of damage dealt, as well as roll on its random drop table! The empowered version of this boss is absolutely nothing to be trifled with either, and even the boldest adventures may very likely find themselves quickly overpowered if they were to attempt the fight on their own, thus it is strongly encouraged less to fall to the temptations of attacking one another and more for the collaborative efforts of overpowering this wicked monster. 

>It is worth noting that this is a deep wilderness event and in a multi-zone, so members will be able to attack one another during this event! A warning is generated when using the Teleport function of the D&D Announcer regarding this.

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/fish.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Fish Whirlpool

This particular event will cause a large whirpool to appear randomly somewhere within the world, from which members will be able to receive spirit flakes and fishing experience from!

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/whirlpoolbanner.png"></center>

When held in your inventory while fishing regular fish, spirit flakes will be consumed to grant a 50% chance to catch double fish. Also, as a very rare chance, members may also be able to receive the Tome of Water from the Fish Whirlpool. This off-hand book provides infinite water runes for casting spells, and boosts the accuracy and damage of water and curse spells by 50% and 20% respectively. The Tome of Water must be charged with Soaked Pages to provide these benefits, which can also be obtained from this event!

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/imp.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Impling Outbreak

During this event, implings will swarm a random location and members will be more than welcome to chase them down and round them up! Implings that spawn during the outbreak are much more likely to be of higher tiers, such as Dragon and Lucky.

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/impbanner.png"></center>

When the outbreak ends, players who'd participated will receive an amount of Hunter experience based on how many implings they caught during the event, plus be able to walk away with everything that'd scavenged from the implings themselves.

<div class="divider div-transparent"></div>

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/sliske.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Sliske's Attack

When this event happens, Sliske will appear at the Barrows area, on top of Ahrim's mound, and summon empowered versions of the Barrows Brothers! Members will be required to defeat the brothers in order to complete the event.

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/sliskebanner.png"></center>

Whilst fighting the brothers, Sliske will spend his energy to heal them. Once he runs out of energy, he will retreat abandoning his wights. Following this, members will be able to take the brothers down completely and will receive drops based on their contributions to the killing of each brother.

Defeating the brothers will reward members with Barrows Shards, coins, and runes! Additionally, there's a slim chance to gain a Barrows Lockbox or Amulet of the Damned. Much like with the Empowered Black Dragon, these iterations of the Barrows Brothers are significantly stronger than the originals and it is strongly encourage that members work together to take them down!

<h1 style="color:#5662f6;">Discord Notifications</h1>

Alongside this patch, we've also made some revisions to the way the Discord notification system works in order to properly accommodate for this new system. For those interested, several new roles have been introduced that members will be able to access by simply heading into the role-selection channel within our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/neoxps">Community Discord</a> and using the corresponding reactions to each event to be notified of their starting time and general location!

<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/121123/notifications.png"></center>

As time goes on and we continue to add new Distractions and Diversions alongside new Neox World Events, these roles will be updated and built upon, so be sure to stay tuned!

> The roles themselves are pinged using Discord's notification system.

Godwars Dungeon Changes

- The Armadyl, Bandos, Saradomin and Zamorak generals now use the same group loot drops system that Nex and the multiway Wilderness bosses use, allowing multiple players to receive loot and kill credit per kill.
- Drop rates have been slightly adjusted due to this change, but remain about the same as before for solo players.
- Kree'arra's ranged defence bonus has been reduced from +200 to +50.
    - The method typically used to bypass Kree'arra's astronomically high ranged defence, splash damage from chinchompas, does not work on Neox. To compensate for this without introducing such an obscure and unintuitive method, we've opted to reduce the defence bonus significantly.

Corporeal Beast Changes

- As with the Godwars dungeon bosses, the Corporeal beast now uses the group loot drops system, in order to incentivize group bossing.
- Sigil drops are now much more common.
- Added a new sigil drop, the divine sigil.
    - Can be used to create the Divine spirit shield, which reduces damage taken by 30%, at the cost of Prayer points equal to half of the amount the damage is reduced by. If you do not have enough Prayer points, the damage will not be reduced.
    - Added the divine sigil to the Corporeal beast section of the Collection Log.
- Reduced stab defence bonus from +25 to -25.
    - Similar to Kree'arra, the main method typically used to kill the Corporeal beast hinges on rather unintuitive mechanics. This change aims to make traditional methods more viable and to support group bossing.
