<em>Hey there, everyone!</em>

<em>We are exceptionally proud to finally present the release of Prifddinas! Within these patch notes, we'll go over what members will be able to expect within this massive content expansion; however we won't be spending too-too much time on explaining all of the little details or this patch would go on near forever!</em> 

<em>Alongside the release of Prif, we'll have a handful of changes, updates, and bug fixes that can be found at the very bottom of this page! Get cozy, grab something to snack on, and let's get started.</em>

<em>Thanks,</em>

<em>Neox Staff</em><br>

<h1 style="color:#c4d9df;">Prifddinas</h1>

Prifddinas, or colloquially known as the City of Elves, is the latest content expansion within Neox. This magical land is home to several new minigames for members to progress through to unlock powerful new weapons, armor, and utility tools, along with a large variety of new shops and areas to explore! We're very excited to be able to finally introduce this expansive piece of content and all of the activities that come with! Over the next little section, we'll touch base on the q-notes version of this magical land including means of access and what to expect!

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/gettingthere.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> Getting There

Getting there is easy enough, it's being <em>allowed inside</em> that can be a little tricky. Access to Prifddinas can be gained through one of two ways: completion of the new Crystal City miniquest - which should take about an hour - or through the Priddinas access pass from the credit store. It's worth noting, however, that the access pass will not grant any of the rewards associated with the miniquest and will solely grant access to the city.

<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

> Although we strongly encourage members to to complete the miniquest, we've decided to add the access pass as an alternative for members who do not wish to participate in that kind of content or are unable to do so due to its requirements, such as a level 3 skiller account who will not be able to complete the combat-oriented sections of the miniquest.
<div class="spacer-small"></div>

<div class="spacer-small"></div>

Once either the miniquest has been complete, or the pass has been purchased and consumed, members will be able to quickly teleport there through the Neox Portal at home, also using it to quickly access both <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Zalcano">Zalcano</a> and <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Gauntlet">The Gauntlet</a>.

### <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/whattoexpect.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:1px;bottom:1px"> What To Expect

With Prifddinas being as expansive as it is, members will be able to pursue competitive placements for new minigames, equipment upgrades in all different kinds of categories, and new activities to partake in to strengthen their accounts. Within this section, we'll go over some of the more highlighted areas and activities for members to explore and what purpose(s) they'll serve within the game.
<div class="spacer-small"></div>

<div class="inner-block">
<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/crystalquest.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> The Access Miniquest</h5>
A recreation of the ever infamous Song of Elves quest, the traditional route for unlocking Prifddinas content will be done through a custom questline featuring some familiar faces! The quest itself has a set of requirements and will house a returning foe that members will later be able to challenge again and again for recurring rewards! It's worth noting that this quest will require the completion of the Lumbridge Tourist and Neox Ruler achievements, and level 70 in the following skills: Agility, Crafting, Farming, Herblore, Hunter, Mining, Smithing, and Woodcutting.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
> As a small bit of advice regarding the final boss, they're particularly weak to magic, so a good Magic level and some mid-level Magic combat equipment is recommended, along with some healing supplies. For more information, be sure to check out Bryce's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1084222360556675153/1209400913542782977">Crystal City Guide</a> on our official Discord!

<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/gauntleticon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> The Gauntlet and Corrupted Gauntlet</h5>
The gauntlet is a solo minigame in which the challenger is given a set window of time to explore through a randomly generated dungeon where they'll gather various resources and supplies by skilling and defeating crystalline monsters, all in preparation to defeat the Crystalline Hunllef! Our iteration of this design doesn't deviate too far from the original game, however with the introduction of modifiers through the respective Prifddinas achievements, players will experience a substantially improved quality of life through their runs!

<center><em><font size="1">Things are about to get interesting!</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
> With the achievement lines such as <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OEs6WjI.png">Gauntlet Challenger</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Epp9gPs.png">Prifddinas Citizen</a>, and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7Ha0Sjd.png">Prifddinas Noble</a>, members are able to unlock Gauntlet perks!

<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/tasksandachievements.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Tasks and Achievements</h5>
What would a Neox update be without a handful of tasks and corresponding achievements? With the introduction of Prifddinas, members will be able to work their way through a new batch of different tasks that will progress their achievement locks. Who doesn't like benefits?
</div>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/singingbowl.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Crystal Singing</h5>
The process in which members will be able to craft their crystal items, crystal singing involves the use of Crystal Shards and the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Singing_bowl">Singing Bowl</a> found within Prifddinas! These items include crystal equipment, crystal armor, and enhanced crystal keys! Use of these bowls requires various smithing and crafting levels, however if you're missing the requirements, you can pay a visit to either Conwenna or Reese who'll be found near the bowls!
</div>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/singinglocation.png"></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
> We actually didn't change anything too interesting about crystal singing! Base design purists rejoice.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<div class="inner-block">
<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/iowerthicon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Iowerth Slayer Dungeon</h5>
Found in the South-West part of Prifddinas, the Iowerth Dungeon is home to several slayer monsters as well as some traitorous Iowerth Warriors! For the most part, this dungeon has been designed true to the nature of the original game, however we've put a handful of improvements into a few different areas that really help to spicen up the experience: 
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - The dungeon has been modified to be multi-target to make bursting through tasks much easier.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - The monsters drop crystal shards, and by extension corrupted fragments.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - The Prifdinnas achievement rewards massively buff the amount of superior monsters you'll find in there.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - There's Krakens which can be farmed whilst off-task.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - There's a new chest located in the beginning of the dungeon that, once unlocked, will automatically pick up all the loot!<br>
</div>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><video autoplay loop muted><source src="/assets/img/updates/030824/chestdialogue.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<center><em><font size="1">"I should go and get that achievement done!" -Fweddy, a non-achievement gamer.</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
> This dungeon contains the following monsters: Moss Giants (84), Kurasks (106), Iowerth Warriors (108), Waterfiends (115), Mutated Bloodvelds (123), Dark Beasts (182), and Greater Nechryaels (200); we've also added in Krakens (127)! It's also worth noting that loot picked up from the chest will need to be collected from the chest at the end, where members can decide what they'd like to do with it.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<div class="inner-block">
<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/elfthievingicon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Elf Thieving</h5>
Thieving from the Elves found in Prifddinas isn't too different from the process of the ones in Lletya (click and forget), however the loot potential is infinitely more interesting! In Prifddinas, the Elves have a chance to give Crystal Shards when pickpocketed, as well as a rare chance to give an Enhanced Crystal Teleport Seed! Keep those fingers nimble.
</div>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/elfyoinking.png"></center>
<center><em><font size="1">So many elf pockets, so little time!</font></em></center>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
> With the Thieving Skilling Cape, Ardougne Noble Achievement, Gloves of Silence, and Prifddinas Noble Achievement completed, members will be able to reach a 100% success rate pickpocketing Elves! Maximum AFK grinding.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<div class="inner-block">
<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/crystalimplings.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Crystal Implings</h5>
The behavior of Crystal Implings hasn't deviated from the original game. Requiring 80 Hunter to catch with a butterfly net and impling jar, or 90 Hunter for a bare-handed catch, these implings can only be found as a rare spawn within Prifddinas!
</div>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/impcatch.png"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/impbounty.png"></center>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
> Crystal Implings have a guaranteed chance to drop Crystal Shards, among other goodies!
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<div class="inner-block">
<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/treeicon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Crystal Tree</h5>
Exclusively grown within Prifddinas, Crystal Trees require 74 Farming to plant. Once planted and grown, the tree can be harvested using an axe to gain Crystal Shards scaling with the type of compost used, and a chance at gaining bird nests. It's worth noting that Magic Secateurs and the Farming Cape have no effect on the yield.

<div class="spacer-small"></div>
> Currently, none of the other Farming related achievements will have an affect on the Crystal Tree. Perhaps... in the future?
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<div class="inner-block">
<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/prifagility.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Prifddinas Agility Course</h5>
Much like a few of the other fairly baseline content pieces of Prifddinas, the agility course hasn't deviated from the design of the original game! Requiring 75 agility to initiate, members may start the course by using the ladder near the North-West bank. 
</div>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/prifportal.png">></center>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
> With usage of the portal shortcuts, the Prifddinas Agility Course becomes impossible to fail at 91 Agility.

<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/chesticon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Crystal Chest + Enchanced Crystal Chest</h5>
Aside from the drastic quality of life improvement in allowing members to use multiple keys at a time, not much has been changed to the Crystal Chest! With the introduction, however, of the Enchanced Crystal Chest, that's where things begin to get interesting. We've modified the loot table of this chest to include <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragonstone_armour">Dragonstone Armor</a>, Onyxes, and a couple of other loot table adjustments. 
</div>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/chests.png">></center>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>
> To add, much like the Crystalystar, the Enhanced Crystal Chest has its own version of the lovely pony... only slightly more corrupt.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<div class="inner-block">
<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/shardsicon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Item Unlocks</h5>
First, it's worth mentioning that the most important currency found within just about every facet of Prifddinas is the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crystal_shard">Crystal Shard</a>. These shards act as the lifeblood of just about every unlock to be had in this region, acting as the base catalyst for every item creation recipe. In good news, whether you're cutting trees, thieving from elves, or running laps on the rooftops, just about every interaction within Prifddinas will generate said shards; the bad news... is that they don't come in very quickly. There's plenty of weapons, skilling tools, and armors to be unlocked, however we'll just quickly touch base on the most renown:

> As you may have noticed, each of the item creation recipes require additional materials aside from the Crystal Shards, including the Enhanced Crystal Weapon Seeds and the Crystal Tool Seeds! Enhanced Crystal Weapon Seeds will drop from The Gauntlet, and Crystal Tool Seeds will drop from Zalcano.
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>

<h5 style="color:#9ec6e1;"> <img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/zalcicon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;position:relative;right:-1px;bottom:2px"> Zalcano</h5>
Zalcano is a demon imprisoned beneath Prifddinas that is fought using skilling rather than conventional combat! Being immune to traditional combat damage, players must use their Mining, Smithing, and Runecraft skills to create Imbued Tephra to destroy her stone armor, and then mine her into oblivion. We've made a handful of adjustments to this boss that should drastically improve upon the experience: 
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - Instances are now available for this boss.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - Onyx drops are much more commonly received from as a reward.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - There's a chance to get Corrupted Fragments for the Fragment of Seren fight.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - The time the boss stays downed is much longer so that soloing is more viable.<br>
</div>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
<center><img src="/assets/img/updates/030824/zalcimg.png"></center>
<div class="spacer-medium"></div>
> With achievements influencing quite a bit of the gameplay, this is no exception! Achievement rewards from both the Prifddinas Citizen and Noble lines will give a chance to duplicate drops as well as reduce damage taken.

In summary, Prifddinas was a monumental undertaking and we're incredibly happy to finally be able to share it with the community! These patch notes hardly touch on all of the content that's being introduced within this patch, but realistically... we didn't want to end up regurgitating too much information from the Wikis. We'd wanted to thank everyone for their patience when it came to the production of this particular piece of content, and it's safe to say we'd learned a lot through the process. 

We've so much planned for the future and can't wait to share it with you all.

            <h3>Improvements</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="spacer-small"></div>

- The wheels in the Motherlode mine now take 60 minutes to break after being repaired, increased from 2 minutes.
- Collecting ore from the sack in the Motherlode mine will now attempt to deposit the collected ore directly into your resource bag, if possible.
- The game message sent when picking plants (such as Flax) is now filtered.
- The Crystal of memories will no longer store your location when used from within The Nightmare's arena.
- The Aerial fishing bird now travels at constant time, rather than constant speed. This means the time it takes to reach its destination is always the same regardless of the distance between you and the target, making the training method much more consistent.
- When dying with a resource bag, the items inside are no longer removed from it, unless you were killed by another player. In that case, the items will now drop to the killer in noted form, if possible.
- Increased the protection value of the Armadyl Godsword.
- Made some changes to the way the Bank reorganizes items that are withdrawn or moved in order to address recent bugs.
- When opening the preset manager interface, global keybinds are now only disabled if the preset manager's own keybinds are enabled.
